{"name":"Eduscript","tagline":"Makes research papers fun","body":"### What is EduScript\r\nSimply put, it is going to make research papers a whole lot easier. Let's face it, MLA, APA, and Chicago are complicated formats that nobody loves. DOC, ODF, and PDF tend to break with different applications. So how is one supposed to work knowing their paper may not view correctly and may have improper formatting. EduScript is an open source web app that plans to take care of that.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\n\r\n### What platforms will this be on?\r\nIt will be a Mac, Window, and Linux app. As of now, the alpha and beta will be free. The plan is to make the syntax free so anyone can make an editor. We are not sure what will happen with the final version. We have many plans, however, we do know that the mobile versions will cost money. This is because it costs money to list apps on app stores.\r\n\r\n### Where can I get this fantastic software?\r\nWell right now it has not been released yet. We plan on an early alpha in two weeks. The original purpose of this app, was a submission for the TSA 2013 National Conference Open Source Software Event. We plan on making this a real app though.","google":"UA-41979153-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
